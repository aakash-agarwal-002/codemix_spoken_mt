Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-large and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.bias', 'roberta.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Lightning automatically upgraded your loaded checkpoint from v1.8.3.post1 to v2.4.0. To apply the upgrade to your files permanently, run `python -m pytorch_lightning.utilities.upgrade_checkpoint ../../../.cache/huggingface/hub/models--Unbabel--wmt22-comet-da/snapshots/2760a223ac957f30acfb18c8aa649b01cf1d75f2/checkpoints/model.ckpt`

You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA A40') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision
